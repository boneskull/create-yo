> Use any Yeoman generator with "npm init"

As of npm v6.1.0, you can [use a custom package](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/20403) with `npm init` to scaffold a project.

## Install

You _could_ install this, but you shouldn't have to. Use `npm` to install globally if you wish.

### Requirements

- Node.js v8.0.0+
- npm v6.1.0+

## Usage

```shell
$ npm init yo <some-generator>[:subgenerator]
```

All Yeoman generator packages start with `generator-`; this prefix is _optional_ **unless you are using a scoped package**. In other words, `npm init yo license` will work just as well as `npm init yo generator-license`, but to use generator `@butts/generator-butts`, you must specify the complete package name with `npm init yo @butts/generator-butts`.

See [a list of generators here](http://yeoman.io/generators/).

## Notes

This package does little other than monkey with arguments and invoke `npx` programmatically.

PRO TIP: After staging your changes with `git add`, use `npm run commit` for a fancy interactive prompt.
